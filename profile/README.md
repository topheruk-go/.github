# Welcome to all things GO 👋🏿👨🏿‍💻

This [Organisation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) has been setup as a way for me to both keep all material related to related material in one place but also have greater exposure to GitHub features.

Once you have had a look through this profile, you can head to my [main profile](https://github.com/topheruk) where I have details on various repositories, organisations & gists

## Repositories

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
